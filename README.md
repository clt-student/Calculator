# Horrible Code Activity - Calculator

This activity includes two versions of a simple calculator program that performs basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

## Good Practice Version
(calculator_good_practice.py) demonstrates the use of the following coding practices:

- **KISS**: Each function does one clear task.
- **DRY Code**: Reused logic to avoid repetition.
- **Document Your Code**: Each function includes helpful docstrings and comments.
- **Clean Code**: Clear variable names, consistent formatting, and good structure.

## Bad Practice Version
(calculator_bad_practice.py) intentionally violates the coding best practices mentioned above.

- No functions or organization (violates KISS)
- Repeated code blocks (violates DRY)
- No comments or documentation (violates Document Your Code)
- Poor formatting and unclear variable names (violates Clean Code)
